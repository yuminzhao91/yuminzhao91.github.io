My research interests include but are not limited to the followingï¼š

* Monitoring the Earth's critical zone, such as soil, groundwater, etc. Analyzing the connections between various factors (such as human activities and environmental factors (precipitation, temperature, pressure, climate, etc.)) and near-surface changes.

* Near-surface imaging/site characterization.

* Seismic inversion propblems.

* Seismic data denoising.

* Detecting anomaly/induced seismicity from large seismic datasets.

* Cutting-edge scientific computational tools, such as deep learning, high-performance computing, and cloud computing. I will apply these tools in my future research projects.
